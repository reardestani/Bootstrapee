Today's freebie is a collection of 7 free PSD profile UI with different styles. In this freebie, we have tried to create 7 different profile UI to meets different users' needs. We hope you enjoy and use it in a creative and nice way.

The 1st one has been designed with a score meter, which can be used to compare different designers' scores and works, feed and ... . 
The rest of them focus on profile widget with different styles. In the 2nd one, you can show name, skills, description, followers, following, events, follow button and do not forget the small green badge. It can be used to feature some of the users' profile.

The 3rd one featuring big image, name, following badge and big icons which is like an administrator widget.

The 4th and 5th have some features like background image, profile avatar, views, comments, like statistics, hire button, social icons, location, name and description.

The 6th is a mobile profile page with circle icons, badge, info, logout buttons, avatar, name and description and the last profile UI is a horizontal UI with name, location, website, twitter, description and featured works.
