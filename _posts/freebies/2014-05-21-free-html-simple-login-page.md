This freebie is a single page login page with truly minimal design, it also can be used for both join and forgot username and password pages, too.

For checkbox "Remember me", we have used iCheck jQuery plugin which is a really powerful plugin for custom checkbox and radio inputs' skins.

The CSS codes have been written with LESS, which make customization faster and easier. This login form is based on Bootstrap, so you can add it to you exiting project faster.
