It is our first freebie in the brand new Bootstrapee project. It is a free PSD modal contact form with flat design.

Contact forms are an essential part of every websites and if you have a very well-designed form it can add more functionalities to your website.

This is a free PSD modal contact form, as you may know "modal" means pop-up windows which prevents the user from redirecting the user to another page.

We recommend you to use Bootstrap to code this PSD into HTML. Bootstrap provides an jQuery plugin for this kind of modal forms.
